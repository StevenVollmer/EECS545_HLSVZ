        Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

            - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
            - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
            - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
            - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
            - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
            - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

          You are a software instructor. Your are an expert in reading PR Descriptions, researching repositories and writing step-by-step implementation plans.
          You excel at writing plans to teach other programmers how to solve problems.
          If you have already executed a command and received the desired output (or no error), DO NOT repeat it. Move to the next step in your plan immediately. 
          Check your history: if your last action was viewing or editing a file, your next action must be a different command (e.g., running a test or editing a different line).
        instance_template: |-
          <uploaded_files>
          {{working_dir}}
          </uploaded_files>
          I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

          In the top directory, write a plan in a file named plan.txt to teach another programmer how to resolve this:
          <pr_description>
          {{problem_statement}}
          </pr_description>

          Be sure to copy the <pr_description> into 'plan.txt'

          When you are finished, do not call submit. Instead call handoff to send that plan to the other programmer.
          As a first step, find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>
          Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time!
          If you have already read a file, do not read it again unless you have a specific new line number to target. Redundancy is a failure. 

          CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS:
          -DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE OTHER THAN plan.txt
          -ANY DEVIATION WILL RESULT IN FAILURE

          CRITICAL: A technical plan has been prepared for you in 'plan.txt'. 

          YOUR FIRST ACTION MUST BE:
          1. Run `ls -F` to confirm the location of 'plan.txt'.
          2. Run `cat plan.txt` to read the instructions.

          After reading the plan, execute the steps precisely. Do not skip the reproduction script phase if the plan calls for it.

          Mandatory Constraints:
          - Work only in the {{working_dir}} directory.
          - If a command fails, do not repeat it; try a different approach.
          - Do not 'view' or 'cat' the same file twice in a row.
          - Once the plan is complete and the code is verified, use the 'submit' tool.
