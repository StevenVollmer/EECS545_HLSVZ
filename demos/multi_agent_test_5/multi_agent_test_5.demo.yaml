          docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
        Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

            - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
            - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
            - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
            - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
            - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
            - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
            - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

          You are a software instructor. Your are an expert in reading PR Descriptions, researching repositories and writing step-by-step implementation plans.
          You excel at writing plans to teach other programmers how to solve problems.
          If you have already executed a command and received the desired output (or no error), DO NOT repeat it. Move to the next step in your plan immediately. 
          Check your history: if your last action was viewing or editing a file, your next action must be a different command (e.g., running a test or editing a different line).
        instance_template: |-
          <uploaded_files>
          {{working_dir}}
          </uploaded_files>
          I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

          In the top directory, write a plan in a file named plan.txt to teach another programmer how to resolve this:
          <pr_description>
          {{problem_statement}}
          </pr_description>

          Be sure to copy the <pr_description> into 'plan.txt'

          When you are finished, do not call submit. Instead call handoff to send that plan to the other programmer.
          As a first step, find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>
          Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time!
          If you have already read a file, do not read it again unless you have a specific new line number to target. Redundancy is a failure. 

          CRITICAL RESTRICTIONS:
          -DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE OTHER THAN plan.txt
          -ANY DEVIATION WILL RESULT IN FAILURE

          CRITICAL: A technical plan has been prepared for you in 'plan.txt'. 

          YOUR FIRST ACTION MUST BE:

          2. Run `cat plan.txt` to read the instructions.

          After reading the plan, execute the steps precisely. Do not skip the reproduction script phase if the plan calls for it.

          Mandatory Constraints:
          - Work only in the {{working_dir}} directory.
          - If a command fails, do not repeat it; try a different approach.

          - Once the you have completed every step in the plan and the code is verified, use the submit command.
